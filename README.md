I wrote this Stata command in honor of Eddie Van Halen.  It will draw three versions of his famous guitar stripes patttern: red/white/black (default), white/black, and black/yellow.  The lines and their thickness are selected randomly and their are options to change the color scheme, number of lines, and you can set the random number seed.
